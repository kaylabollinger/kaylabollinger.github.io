												My undergraduate degree is in Physics, and in my last year I took an elective course called 
												"Mathematical Modeling". It was my first class that required a significant amount of coding, 
												and we worked with all sorts of interesting datasets. I loved every minute of it. This newfound 
												interest led me to continuing my education at the graduate level. By May 2022 I graduated with 
												my PhD in Applied Mathematics, and I had a thesis filled with coding and data modeling--a cherry 
												on top of an academic career that started all the way back with that elective course.
												<br><br>
												Now, I'm looking to take these skills into a professional role. I'm also continuing 
												to expand my data analysis toolkit with courses like the "Google Data Analytics" course on Coursera, 
												and by creating a variety of <a href="../index.html#portfolio"><u>portfolio projects</u></a> to 
												practice and showcase different technical skills.
												<br><br>
												When I'm not coding, I like to be involved in my community. For a long time my community was a 
												university, and I was involved in several student support focused programs. During my graduate program 
												I co-founded and was co-president of our university's first Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) 
												chapter. AWM is an organization dedicated to supporting underrepresented minorites interested in 
												mathematics, and it was a joy to be a part of it. I was also a departmental representative for our 
												university's Graduate Student Assembly (GSA) which supports graduate students in a variety of ways, ranging from 
												organizing fun social events to advocating for graduate student rights on Capitol Hill. 
												<br><br>
												Finally, when I need to unwind from all of the above, I like to rock climb. I was fortunate enough to have 
												access to a climbing wall at my undergraduate university and that's where my interest in the sport began. 
												I've never been the strongest climber out there, but I did one time win a team-oriented climbing competition 
												(which I shamelessy take any opportunity to brag about).

													included Radunskaya and five other (plus one impromptu) amazing panelists: Dean Rebecca Doerge, Professor 
													Fatma Kilin&ccedil;-Karzan, Professor Franziska Weber, Professor Irina Gheorghiciuc, Ariel Levavi, and (our impromptu guest 
													who graciously offered to join our panel) Professor Lenore Blum--one of the original founders of AWM.

													The (in)famous rock climbing competition won by me and my climbing buddies. Winning this competition was a little bit 
													like winning a quidditch match by being behind in points the whole time and then accidentally swallowing the golden 
													snitch in the end. But we still won, so we were happy.
